This is a very basic version of the snake game so you should be expecting anything suiper special.

The key binding for playing the game are as follows:

w - move the snake like object UP.
a - move the snake like object LEFT.
s - move the snake like object DOWN.
d - move the snake like object RIGHT.

How the Game Works: - You as the snake, you move around the game board with the permitted key bindings and you attempt to the green food, when a food is eaten, your score increases, the food respawns in another area and oit goes on and on forever ***TO INFINIY :)***
